# TODO list

- Optimization of the perception
  - Define and implement a QuadTree structure
  - Make the vehicle register to the QuadTree structure when spawned
  - Use the QuadTree structure to compute the perceptions
  - *Remark: Perception is actually computed by RadarPerceptionProvider in car-behavior*

- Simulate V2X communication
  - Allow vehicle to broadcast and receive network messages
  - Implement a simulation of intersection with V2X communication for right-of-way

- Allow control of simulation elements (vehicle behavior, traffic lights, etc.) through network to enable connection
